## What is Docker? üê≥

Docker is a **Containerization** platform for packaging, deploying, and running applications as **CONTAINERS.**

## What is containerization? üì¶

C**ontainerization** is a lightweight form of virtualization that allows you to encapsulate an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit called a "container." 
****

Docker applications run in **containers** that can be used on any system: a developer‚Äôs laptop, systems on premises, or in the cloud. (it runs the same)

![Untitled](Docker%20Course%20fab23a1bc7bc400caa627a6c8faf36f0/Untitled%201.png)

Containers share the host operating system's kernel, but they have their own isolated file system, processes, and networking.

## Difference between VMs & Containers

![Untitled](Docker%20Course%20fab23a1bc7bc400caa627a6c8faf36f0/Untitled%202.png)

| Aspect | Containers | Virtual Machines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Resource Usage | Lightweight, efficient | Heavier, more resource usage |
| Startup Time | Quick start | Slower start |
| Isolation | Process-level separation | Full OS isolation |
| Portability | Highly portable | Compatibility concerns |
| Resource Overhead | Minimal overhead | Higher overhead |
| Isolation Level | Lighter isolation | Stronger isolation |

<aside>
üí° It‚Äôs important to note that Docker containers don‚Äôt run in their own virtual machines, but share a Linux kernel. Compared to virtual machines, containers use less memory and less CPU.

However, a Linux runtime is required for Docker. Implementations on non-Linux platforms such as macOS and Windows 10 use a single Linux virtual machine. The containers share this system.

- Consistent test environment for development and QA.
- Cross-platform packages called images.
- Isolation and encapsulation of application dependencies.
- Ability to scale efficiently, easily, and in real time.
- Enhances efficiency via easy reuse of images.

Disadvantage
Compatibility issue: Windows container won‚Äôt run on Linux machines and vice versa

### Docker Architecture

![Untitled](Docker%20Course%20fab23a1bc7bc400caa627a6c8faf36f0/Untitled%204.png)

Docker uses a client-server architecture to manage and run containers:

1. **Docker Client:**
    - The Docker client is the command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) that users interact with to build, manage, and control Docker containers.
    - It sends commands to the Docker daemon to perform various tasks.
2. **Docker Daemon:**
    - The Docker daemon is a background process that manages Docker containers on a host system.
    - It listens for Docker API requests and takes care of building, running, and managing containers.
3. **Docker Registry:**
    - Docker images can be stored and shared through Docker registries.
    - A Docker registry is a repository for Docker images, and it can be public (like Docker Hub) or private.
4. **Docker Hub:**
    - Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service provided by Docker, where users can find, share, and store Docker images.
    - It serves as a central repository for Docker images.
    

Here's a high-level overview of the interaction between these components:

- The Docker client communicates with the Docker daemon, sending commands and receiving information about containers, images, etc.
- Docker images are fetched or built from the Docker registry.
- Containers are created, started, stopped, and managed by the Docker daemon.

## Dockerfile Instructions

![Untitled](Docker%20Course%20fab23a1bc7bc400caa627a6c8faf36f0/Untitled%206.png)

## Docker Image

A Docker image is a read-only template containing a set of instructions for creating a container that can run on the Docker platform. Docker images are also the starting point for anyone using Docker for the first time.

![Untitled](Docker%20Course%20fab23a1bc7bc400caa627a6c8faf36f0/Untitled%207.png)

Challenges
Run a container with the¬†`nginx:1.14-alpine`¬†image and name it¬†`webapp`

docker run -p 5000:80 ‚Äîname webapp -d `nginx:1.14-alpine` 

Challenge 2

Containerize Python application and push the image to DockerHub

Step 1- Create Python app

Step 2 - Write Dockerfile for the app

Step 3 - Create image for the app

Step 4 - Run the container for the app 

Step 5 - If it works push the image on Dockerhub

ENV variables

- **Purpose**: Environment variables in Docker are used to configure applications, control runtime behavior, and manage sensitive information.
- **Configuration**: They replace hardcoded values in configuration files, enabling flexibility across different environments.
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Environment variables can control feature toggles, logging levels, and runtime environments.
- **Secrets Management**: Sensitive data like passwords or API keys can be securely injected into containers using environment variables.
- **Setting Variables**:
    - Use `ENV` instruction in Dockerfile to set variables during image build.
    - Pass variables with `e` or `-env` flag in `docker run` command.
    - Define them in `docker-compose.yml` under the `environment` key.
    - In Docker Swarm, set them with `docker service create/update` or in a Docker Compose file for Swarm.
- **Flexibility and Portability**: Environment variables make Dockerized applications easier to manage and deploy across diverse environments.

### Challenge

Run a container named¬†`blue-app`¬†using image¬†`kodekloud/simple-webapp`¬†and set the environment variable¬†`APP_COLOR`¬†to¬†`blue`. Make the application available on port¬†`38282`¬†on the host. The application listens on port¬†`8080`.

- Solution
    
    docker run -d \
    --name blue-app \
    -p 38282:8080 \
    -e APP_COLOR=blue \
    kodekloud/simple-webapp
    

## Commands & Arguments

<aside>
üí° Always remember that a container does not host an operating system; instead, it runs a process and will be terminated once the process is completed.

</aside>

```docker
# Use a base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Run a sleep command when the container starts
CMD ["sleep", "3600"]
```

**`CMD ["sleep", "3600"]`** ‚úÖ   **`CMD ["sleep 3600"]`** ‚ùå

it's recommended to use the first form (**`CMD ["sleep", "3600"]`**) to specify the command and its arguments as separate elements in a JSON array for clarity and to ensure proper execution.

ENTRYPOINT

**`ENTRYPOINT`** is a Dockerfile instruction that specifies the command to run when a container is started from the Docker image. Unlike **`CMD`**, which provides default arguments to the command defined by **`ENTRYPOINT`**, **`ENTRYPOINT`** sets the main command that will be executed when the container starts, regardless of any arguments provided at runtime.

```docker
FROM alpine:latest

# Set the sleep command as the entry point
ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]

# Set a default sleep time of 3600 seconds (1 hour)
CMD ["3600"]
```

Explanation:

- This Dockerfile starts with a base image of Alpine Linux.
- The **`ENTRYPOINT`** instruction specifies that the **`sleep`** command will be the main command to run when the container starts.
- The **`CMD`** instruction sets a default argument for the **`sleep`** command, specifying the sleep time in seconds. In this case, the default sleep time is 3600 seconds (1 hour).

Override arguments

```docker
docker run my_image **1800**   # Sleeps for 1800 seconds (30 minutes)
```

Communication Between containers.

for multiple containers dependent on one another we can command line argument ‚Äîlink

When using the `--link` option in Docker:

- A secure tunnel is created between containers for communication.
- Environment variables are set in the destination container, providing details about the linked container.
- Docker updates the `/etc/hosts` file in the destination container to resolve the hostname of the linked container.
- Access to exposed ports in the linked container is provided.
- Docker implicitly creates a network bridge interface for secure communication between linked containers.

- Example
    1. **Run MySQL Container**: Start the MySQL container with a name `mysql-container`, exposing port 3306:
        
        ```bash
        docker run --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password -d mysql:latest
        
        ```
        
    2. **Create a .NET Core Application**: Assume you have a .NET Core application that needs to connect to the MySQL database. Build the .NET Core application and create a Docker image for it. Here's a simple Dockerfile assuming the application is published to a folder named `app`:
        
        ```
        FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/runtime:latest
        WORKDIR /app
        COPY ./app .
        ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "YourApp.dll"]
        
        ```
        
    3. **Run .NET Core Application Container Linked to MySQL**: Now, run the .NET Core application container, linking it to the MySQL container:
        
        ```bash
        docker run --name dotnet-app --link mysql-container:mysql -d your-dotnet-image:latest
        
        ```
        
    
    In this example:
    
    - `-name mysql-container` assigns the name `mysql-container` to the MySQL container.
    - `e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password` sets the root password for MySQL.
    - `-name dotnet-app` assigns the name `dotnet-app` to the .NET Core application container.
    - `-link mysql-container:mysql` links the .NET Core application container to the MySQL container with an alias `mysql`.
    - `d` runs both containers in detached mode.
    
    Inside the .NET Core application container, you can now access the MySQL database using the hostname `mysql` and the exposed port. Make sure your .NET Core application is configured to connect to MySQL using the correct hostname and port.
    

<aside>
üí° However, as of Docker version 1.9, the **`--link`** option is considered a legacy feature, and Docker recommends using user-defined networks instead for inter-container communication. User-defined networks provide better isolation, scalability, and ease of use compared to the legacy linking mechanism.

### Docker Volumes:

Docker volumes are a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They provide a mechanism for sharing data between a host machine and Docker containers or between containers themselves.

### Types of Volumes:

1. **Named Volumes:** Managed by Docker, easier to use and manage.
2. **Host Volumes:** Maps a directory from the host machine into the container.
3. **Anonymous Volumes:** Similar to named volumes but managed by Docker with a randomly generated name.

### Commands:

1. **Create a named volume:**
    
    ```bash
    docker volume create my_volume
    
    ```
    
2. **Run a container with a named volume:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -v my_volume:/path/in/container image_name
    
    ```
    
3. **List all volumes:**
    
    ```bash
    docker volume ls
    
    ```
    
4. **Inspect a volume:**
    
    ```bash
    docker volume inspect my_volume
    
    ```
    
5. **Remove a volume:**
    
    ```bash
    docker volume rm my_volume
    
    ```
    
6. **Mount a host directory as a volume:**
    
    ```bash
    docker run -v /host/path:/container/path image_name
    
    ```
    

### Dockerfile Example:

```
# Define a volume
VOLUME /data

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /data

# Copy files into the container
COPY . /data

```

### Docker Compose Example:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    image: my_app_image
    volumes:
      - my_volume:/app/data

volumes:
  my_volume:
    external: true

```

### Key Points:

- Volumes are useful for persisting data even if containers are removed.
- They can be shared between containers.
- Docker volumes are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker.
